/*
The Mirror Pattern, also known as the Twin Pattern or Peer Pattern, is a design pattern that involves creating two or more objects that are similar or identical and have a reflective relationship with each other. These objects, often referred to as mirrors or twins, mirror each other's state and behavior, allowing them to stay synchronized and respond to changes in a consistent manner.

The Mirror Pattern is useful in situations where you need multiple instances of an object to work together closely and stay synchronized. It is commonly used in distributed systems, concurrent programming, and real-time systems.

Key Elements of the Mirror Pattern:
1. Mirrors/Twins: The primary entities in the pattern are the mirrors or twins. 
These objects have a reflective relationship, meaning they share a common set of state and behavior.

2. State Synchronization: The mirrors maintain synchronized state with each other.
 When one mirror updates its state, the changes are propagated to other mirrors, 
 ensuring consistency across all instances.

3. Behavior Synchronization: The mirrors also synchronize their behavior.
 When one mirror performs a certain action or operation, the other mirrors 
 replicate the same behavior.

4. Communication: Mirrors communicate with each other to exchange state updates
 and coordinate their actions. This communication can be direct or mediated through
 a central entity known as a mediator or coordinator.

Benefits of the Mirror Pattern:
- Synchronization: The Mirror Pattern ensures that multiple instances stay synchronized, avoiding inconsistencies in state or behavior.
- Modularity: Each mirror can be designed and developed independently, allowing for modular and scalable systems.
- Fault Tolerance: The pattern can enhance fault tolerance by allowing one mirror to take over the responsibilities of another in case of failure.
- Performance Optimization: Mirrors can distribute processing load among themselves, improving system performance in distributed or parallel computing scenarios.

Example Scenario:
Let's consider an example scenario where the Mirror Pattern can be applied: a distributed 
caching system. The goal is to design a system that stores and retrieves cached data efficiently 
across multiple nodes while ensuring consistency and synchronization.

In this scenario, we can have multiple cache nodes, each acting as a mirror/twin of the others.
 The cache nodes share a common cache state and synchronize their state and behavior to provide a consistent caching service.

Whenever a client requests data from the cache, any of the cache nodes can respond.
 If the requested data is not available in the local cache, the node can forward the 
 request to other cache nodes. When a cache node receives an update or modification 
 to the cache state, it propagates the changes to other nodes to keep the cache synchronized.

The Mirror Pattern allows the cache nodes to work together as a distributed cache, 
providing fault tolerance, load balancing, and efficient data retrieval. 
The mirrors ensure that the cache state remains consistent across all nodes,
and clients can transparently interact with any node without worrying about
the underlying distribution and synchronization mechanisms.

By applying the Mirror Pattern in this scenario, we achieve a robust and scalable distributed 
caching system that can handle high loads, ensure data consistency, and provide fault 
tolerance by replicating data across multiple nodes.*/
